[color=#a4885c]0.[/color] [color=#a4885c]The[/color] [color=#ffd700]Golden[/color] [color=#a4885c]Rule.[/color] Admins may excercise discretion with rules as they see fit. If you rule lawyer or line skirt, you will get removed. Admins will answer for use of this privilege.

[color=#ff0000]ZERO TOLERANCE RULES[/color]

[color=#a4885c]1.[/color] Absolutely no hate speech, slurs, bigotry, IC specism (demeaning other characters in-game due to their in-game race), or anything even remotely similar.

[color=#a4885c]2.[/color] Absolutely no Erotic Roleplay (ERP) or sexual content, including direct or indirect mentions of sexual behavior or actions.

[color=#a4885c]3.[/color] Don't communicate in-game/in-character information through methods outside of the game (such as talking in Discord with other users actively playing or by talking to your sibling across the room while you are both playing). This is referred to as "Metacomming" and we are not able to police it, therefore it is strictly forbidden.

[color=#a4885c]4.[/color] Attempting to evade game bans will result in an automatic appeal-only permanent ban that is only appealable after six months. Attempting to evade job bans will result in an appeal-only permanent ban.

[color=#ff0000]GENERAL ETIQUETTE[/color]

[color=#a4885c]5.[/color] These are English servers. Speak only English in IC and OOC. Usage of google translate is not permitted, players are expected to have a decent grasp on english grammar.

[color=#a4885c]6.[/color] Don't use exploits or external programs to play, gain an advantage, or disrupt the round/server. This includes autoclickers and auto-hotkey scripts.

[color=#a4885c]7.[/color] Don't "multi-key" (utilize multiple alt accounts). Users knowingly using multiple SS14 accounts will have all of their accounts banned.

[color=#a4885c]8.[/color] Do not ignore the admin help relay or abuse it by flooding it with garbage, checking for admins before stating a problem (ex: "hello?", "any admins?"), or sending messages of no substance. All admin helps are sent to the SS14 Discord.

[color=#ff0000]IN GAME & ROLEPLAY RULES[/color]

[color=#a4885c]9.[/color] Pick a realistic name that could appear on a birth certificate with at least a first and last name (leeway is given to this for Clowns, Mimes, and non-human races).
    - Names of notable famous or fictional persons or names that resemble/parody them are strictly forbidden. You are not clever if you slightly change a famous name around. Terrible names open you up to being politely reminded to change it, smited, or instantly banned, depending on severity.

[color=#a4885c]10.[/color] Afterlight is a Roleplay Required environment, you are expected to know how to roleplay well. This does not mean you need to, for example, engage in "pain rp" and scream about having broken a leg, or remember to *breathe, but avoid breaking character unless you're certain it'll be funny for everyone involved and won't detract from the experience.
    - Afterlight has a semi-persistent world and persistent story. Any progress made in the game's storyline is permanent for all players and as such it's expected that characters will remember one another between rounds.

[color=#a4885c]12.[/color] Don't harass or target players across rounds for actions in prior rounds or for actions outside of the game (this is referred to as "Metagrudging".)
    - Annoying players for IC reasons in the current round is fine; doing it across rounds or as a ghost role after they kill you is not.
    - Afterlight is a persistent experience, you are allowed and expected to remember characters between rounds, but for the sake of avoiding nasty situations please do not kill people over their prior behavior.

[color=#a4885c]13.[/color] Don't use information gained from outside your character's knowledge to gain an advantage (this is referred to as "Metagaming").
    - Using information you gain from outside your own character (such as spectating while a ghost, through screenshots or metacomms, or other means) to your advantage is strictly forbidden. You remember all events up until you fall unconscious, even after cloning. If you take a ghost role, unless otherwise stated, you DO NOT REMEMBER ANYTHING from your past life.
    - UPON RESPAWNING YOU MUST PICK A DIFFERENT CHARACTER AND REMEMBER NO INFORMATION ABOUT THE CURRENT ROUND.
    - New Life Rule is in effect - Do not use information obtained while dead or from a previous life upon returning to the land of the living. Even if you are cloned, you do not remember the events culminating in your death.

[color=#a4885c]14.[/color] Follow escalation rules and don't murder someone for slipping you, use common sense.
    - You can defend yourself to the extent of protecting your own life.
    - Adminhelp the situation if you think someone is over-escalating.
    - The escalation rules are not listed here as this is a whitelisted experience, but it is important to note that if you have reason to fight to the death, you're not expected to nurse people back to health. The respawn option exists for a reason.

[color=#a4885c]15.[/color] Don't immediately ghost or suicide from your role, this screws over other players and will quickly net you a ban, as this server doesn't even have antagonists to roll for.

[color=#a4885c]16.[/color] Intentionally making yourself a major problem/annoyance/disruption for other players is prohibited. While fights and arguments happen, up to and including murder over disputes, you shouldn't be seeking to actively disrupt everyone's play experience.
    - If a crew explicitly expresses desire to remain non-combatants, it is good courtesy to not drag them into whatever mess you've created. Keep PVP between vessels interested in PVP.

[color=#ff0000]UNORGANIZED NOTES[/color]
As I'm pretty bad at writing rules:
    - You're not expected to tell anyone you're logging out if you're the last member of your crew OR you have no way of contacting your crew.
    - Going through people's derelict vessels is part of the experience, however it is polite to not start scrapping a ship if the lights are still on, as players may return. Additionally, do not space the spawning area if you can help it.
